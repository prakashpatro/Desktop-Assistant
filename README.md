A simple Desktop Assistant made using python.

## Try it yourself

At least Python 3.6 is required.

### PyAudio file or wheels package may be missing from your system, I have added the file here

If missing from your system, download the file and run  --- pip install "path of the downloaded file"

# Run the code

Now, you should be able to listen to the desktop assistant Stella greet you. You can ask the assistant to perform various tasks and also add your own tasks into the program.
